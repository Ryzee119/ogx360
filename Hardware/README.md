# ogx360 - Hardware
This folder contains the schematic and PCB layout files and the PCB Gerber files. These were created using [Autodesk Eagle.](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview)

* The PCB Gerbers and BOM are located [here](../.kitspace/).
* These can easily be ordered via [kitspace](https://kitspace.org/boards/github.com/ryzee119/ogx360).
  * Note: you may wish to order extra of the small components (resistors, capacitors, etc.) as it is easy to loose some when hand-soldering.
* 3D model of the PCB is [here](https://a360.co/3aavAXA) (Fusion360).
* Note: On the corner of the Arduino modules there is a solder jumper labelled J1. It is recommended you bridge this with a solder blob.
