## Steel Battalion controller emulation
* You need a wireless Xbox 360 controller with a chatpad peripheral.
* You can change what the controller appears to the console at anytime, so you can use the 'Duke Controller' to boot into the game, then change to the 'Steel Battalion controller' whilst in game. 
* Button mapping is below. (High Res image available [here](https://i.imgur.com/12SawzC.png)).
